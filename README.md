<h1>CURRENT MIRROR CIRCUIT</h1>
<p> In the IC,the Mosfet amplifiers are baised using the CURRENT SOURCE. Typically in the IC's this current mirror is used as a current source. The main advantage of the baising the amplifier with the constant current is that it provides high voltage gain and it also improves the baising stability.</p>
