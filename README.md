# Experiment-6-currentmirror
<h1>CURRENT MIRROR</h1>     
<p> In the IC,the Mosfet amplifiers are baised using the CURRENT SOURCE. Typically in the IC's this current mirror is used as a current source. The main advantage of the baising the amplifier with the constant current is that it provides high voltage gain and it also improves the baising stability.</p>

<h3>AIM</h3>
<b>Design and analyze current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit</b>
<b>Circuit daigram</b>


<br><b>1.</b> Design for Av>-10v/v, VDD=1.8v, P<=1mw
<br>Itotal=P/VDD   and  Itotal=Iref+Ix
<br>design for the current mirror ratio----> 1:1 and 1:2 

<br><b>2.</b>Analyze the circuit current mirror--->DC analysis

<br><b>3. case1:a)</b>Lmin=180nm      (W/L)=x
<br>             <b>b)</b>l=500nm     (W/L)=x
<br>             <b>c)</b>L=1um       (W/L)=x
<br>Avalyze the current mirroring maintain (W/L) same as first design
<br><b>4.</b>Transient and AC analysis
<br> Maximum output swing
<br>BW

<br><b>Vary the current mirror ratio and analyze the current copying/mirroring</b>

<b>Circuit daigram 2</b>

Design the differential Amplifier using the same design specification as experiment 3 ---> differencial amplifier, Perform DC analysis, transient analysis and AC analysis
