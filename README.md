# Experiment-6-currentmirror
<h1>CURRENT MIRROR</h1>     
<p> In the IC,the Mosfet amplifiers are baised using the CURRENT SOURCE. Typically in the IC's this current mirror is used as a current source. The main advantage of the baising the amplifier with the constant current is that it provides high voltage gain and it also improves the baising stability.</p>
<br>The current mirror is an analog circuit that senses the reference current and generates the copy or number of copies of the reference current, with the same characteristics. The replicated current is as stable as the reference current source. The replicated current could be the same as the reference current (Icopy = IREF), or it could be either multiple or fraction of the reference current.

<h3>AIM</h3>
<b>Design and analyze current mirror circuit as active load in amplifier circuit</b>
<br><b>Circuit daigram</b>


<br><b>1.</b> Design for Av>-10v/v, VDD=1.8v, P<=1mw
<br>Itotal=P/VDD   and  Itotal=Iref+Ix
<br>design for the current mirror ratio----> 1:1 and 1:2 
<br><b>2.</b>Analyze the circuit current mirror--->DC analysis
<br><b>3. case1:a)</b>Lmin=180nm      (W/L)=x
<br>             <b>b)</b>l=500nm     (W/L)=x
<br>             <b>c)</b>L=1um       (W/L)=x
<br>Avalyze the current mirroring maintain (W/L) same as first design
<br><b>4.</b>Transient and AC analysis
<br> Maximum output swing
<br>BW

<br><b>Vary the current mirror ratio and analyze the current copying/mirroring</b>

<b>Circuit daigram 2</b>
